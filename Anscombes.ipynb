    "**Who was Anscombes**\n",
    "Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe was a philosopher (born March 18, 1919, Limerick, Ire.—died Jan. 5, 2001, Cambridge, Eng.). She was one of the most gifted philosophers of the twentieth century. Her work continues to strongly influence philosophers working in action theory and moral philosophy. \n",
    "She was a close associate of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and translator of his work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although she worked in almost every area of philosophy, she is best known to philosophers today for her work on ethics and the philosophy of action. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In ethics, her most important work is the paper “Modern Moral Philosophy.” Contemporary interest in virtue theory can be traced directly to this paper, which put forward three theses: that all the major British moral philosophers from Henry Sidgwick on were essentially the same (that is, consequentialists); that the concepts of moral obligation, the use of the word ought with a special moral sense, and related notions, are harmful and should be dropped; and that we should stop doing moral philosophy until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her work on action, found mostly in her short book Intention, was a step in the direction of such a philosophy.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "***Work:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the list of all the works by Anscombe in order to investigate if there could be any relationship with any of them and the Anscombe's quartet dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Until this point of the investigation all the works appear to be phylosopically related. \n",
    "The research in this task will continue on the review of Anscombes data set and the contributions and translations Anscombes made about Ludwig Wittgenstein (logic and mathematics philosopher) At this point, an hipotesis would be that may be a link between the contributions she made on Ludwig Wittgenstein and the data set.\n",

    "The base of the interest of the Anscombe's quartet dataset is that even a set of unmbers can have the same mean X and Y and the regression line that best fits the 4th of them is the same, the data varies significntly between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, studying the data set the variance of both X and Y (and hence the standard deviation) is also the pretty much the same in every chart. As is the correlation coefficient of X and Y, and the regression line that would be the line of best fit if were you to generate a linear model based on each of those 4 datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is to show the true power of data visualisation. There are some summary stats that  might be so summarised that they can lead to an entirely misleading perception. Then the importance of this data set is the exemplification that summarising in excess the data can lead to wrong predictions or interpretations and the importance of visualisation to identify this variations. In the Anscombes quartet dataset thanks to the visualisation of the data the differences are made clear."
